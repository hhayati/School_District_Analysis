# School_District_Analysis
##Overview of the school district analysis
The goal for this challenge was to analyze the school district’s data to study the student’s passing percentage in math and reading exams and its relation to the school type, size and spending budget. In particular, it was investigated how exclusion of the scores from 9th grade students from one high school may affect the results.
## Data screening  
The district found strong evidence that math and reading scores  for 9th grade students at Thomas High School have been manipulated. As a result, the district decided to exclude those grades from the analysis. The screen shot below shows that the reading and math scores for those students were replaced by NaN.
